1)Getx use this way in handling instances or objects
1)create object from each class in dependencies page but not instantiate it until it calls for
    first time and then it automatically will add it to Get so now Get Package have all the
    objects that you created
     and we do that using Get.put....  or Get.lazyPut....

call:==>CartRepo cartRepo; that's also will create an instance from CartRepo and then when you use Get.find<CartRepo> this instance will be called
     ==>Get.find
     ==>GetBuilder          both of them are assumed as a call to Gets' Objects

2)then we have two approaches to use this object
    1)if we just want to get an instance from our OBJECT in Get
        ==>Get.find
    2)if we want to make the instance changes whenever data is depending on has changed
        so every change in data = rebuild widgets tree (automatically)
        ==>Get.builder<xx>(builder:(instance of xx){ return...});

remark: The difference between GetBuilder and Get.find is that Get.find is a simple call
    to retrieve an instance of an object stored in the Get object, while GetBuilder provides
    a way to automatically rebuild the widget tree whenever the data changes.
