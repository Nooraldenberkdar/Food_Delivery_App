in GetX we used to use Dependency injection in every object we are going to create

for ex:
we want to use popularFoodController in 1 2 3
so we create it once GetBuilder<CartController>(builder:(cartController)
so every time the data changes in CartController the builder re-build the instance(cartController)
in 1 then we use Get.find<PopularFoodController>(). .. in 2 and 3
thus we use one instance of PopularFood in three places
